Howdy Folks,

Rob Bigelow here. I'm a programmer by trade, though they call me a software engineer at work. Having just finished up my MSCS, I'm currently embarking on a journey into the fascinating field of computer graphics. My first goal is to work through the copy of Real Time Rendering, 4th edition, which has been sitting on my shelf for the past year, tempting me from my studies. Coupled with that, I'll be learning Metal, and some more Swift, so that I might have some fun demoes to show on my iPad when I attend i3d next year (the day after Star Wars day!)

That's all for now. Back to the tutorial...
